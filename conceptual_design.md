# MMIS Ghana - Conceptual Design Document

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the conceptual design for the Municipal Management Information System (MMIS) for a typical District Assembly in Ghana. The system aims to centralize data, streamline workflows, and enhance operational efficiency and transparency. This is a living document and will be updated as the project evolves.

## 2. System Scope and Core Modules

The MMIS will encompass the following key departmental functionalities:

*   **Human Resources & Payroll Management:** Employee records, leave, attendance, performance, payroll, training.
*   **Accounts & Financial Management:** Revenue collection, expenditure, budgeting, financial reporting.
*   **Town & Country Planning:** Application management for permits, document management, inspections, GIS integration (conceptual).
*   **Births & Deaths Registry:** Registration, certificate issuance, statistical reporting.
*   **General Administration & Cross-Cutting Features:** Document Management System (DMS), User Management & Access Control, Reporting & Analytics Dashboard, Audit Trails, Internal Communications.

## 3. High-Level System Architecture

*   **Type:** Web-based application.
*   **Framework:** Django (Python web framework).
*   **Database:** SQLite (for development, PostgreSQL recommended for production).
*   **Deployment (Conceptual):** Could be hosted on a local server within the District Assembly or a cloud-based server, depending on infrastructure and connectivity.
*   **User Interface:** Accessed via web browsers. The design will prioritize ease of use for staff with varying computer literacy, drawing inspiration from the provided Stitch UI mockups.

## 4. Core Database Entities and Relationships (Initial Draft)

This section outlines the primary entities (models in Django) and their key relationships as currently implemented or planned for the initial phases.

### 4.1. General Administration (`general_admin`)

*   **User (Django Built-in `django.contrib.auth.models.User`):**
    *   Fields: `username`, `password`, `email`, `first_name`, `last_name`, etc.
*   **UserProfile (`general_admin.UserProfile`):**
    *   Fields: `user` (OneToOne to User), `department` (ForeignKey to Department), `role` (e.g., Admin, HR Officer), `contact_phone`.
    *   Purpose: Extends the built-in User model with MMIS-specific attributes.
*   **Department (`general_admin.Department`):**
    *   Fields: `name`, `description`.
    *   Purpose: Represents departments within the District Assembly.
*   **AuditLog (`general_admin.AuditLog`):**
    *   Fields: `user` (ForeignKey to User), `action` (e.g., CREATE, UPDATE), `timestamp`, `description`.
    *   Purpose: Tracks significant system activities.

### 4.2. Human Resources & Payroll (`hr_payroll`)

*   **Employee (`hr_payroll.Employee`):**
    *   Fields: `user` (OneToOne to User, optional), `employee_id` (unique), `first_name`, `last_name`, `date_of_birth`, `gender`, `contact_number`, `email`, `employment_date`, `job_title`. (Department will be linked via UserProfile or a direct ForeignKey).
    *   Purpose: Stores all employee information.
    *   *Future additions:* `LeaveRecord`, `AttendanceRecord`, `PayrollData`, `PerformanceAppraisal`, `TrainingRecord`.

### 4.3. Accounts & Financial Management (`finance`)

*   **RevenueSource (`finance.RevenueSource`):**
    *   Fields: `name` (e.g., Property Rate), `description`.
*   **RevenueCollection (`finance.RevenueCollection`):**
    *   Fields: `source` (ForeignKey to RevenueSource), `amount`, `date_collected`, `collected_by` (ForeignKey to Employee/User), `receipt_number`.
    *   *Future additions:* `Expenditure`, `Budget`, `Supplier`.

### 4.4. Town & Country Planning (`planning`)

*   **PermitApplication (`planning.PermitApplication`):**
    *   Fields: `application_id` (unique), `applicant_name`, `application_type`, `application_date`, `status`, `property_location_details`.
    *   *Future additions:* `ApplicationDocument` (for uploaded plans), `InspectionReport`.

### 4.5. Births & Deaths Registry (`registry`)

*   **BirthRegistration (`registry.BirthRegistration`):**
    *   Fields: `registration_id` (unique), `child_first_name`, `child_last_name`, `date_of_birth`, `place_of_birth`, `gender`, `father_full_name`, `mother_full_name`, `registration_date`, `certificate_number`.
*   **DeathRegistration (`registry.DeathRegistration`):**
    *   Fields: `registration_id` (unique), `deceased_first_name`, `deceased_last_name`, `date_of_death`, `place_of_death`, `age_at_death_years`, `cause_of_death`, `registration_date`, `certificate_number`.

*(This list is not exhaustive and will expand as module development progresses.)*

## 5. Key Functionalities by Module (Initial Thoughts)

### 5.1. Human Resources & Payroll
*   Add, view, edit, delete employee records.
*   (Future) Manage leave applications and track balances.
*   (Future) Record staff attendance.
*   (Future) Process payroll, considering salaries, deductions, benefits.

### 5.2. Accounts & Financial Management
*   Record revenue collected from various sources.
*   (Future) Track expenditures and manage purchase orders.
*   (Future) Create and monitor budgets.
*   (Future) Generate basic financial reports.

### 5.3. Town & Country Planning
*   Log new permit applications.
*   Track application status.
*   (Future) Upload and manage application documents.
*   (Future) Schedule and record inspections.

### 5.4. Births & Deaths Registry
*   Register new births and capture relevant details.
*   Register new deaths and capture relevant details.
*   (Future) Issue and track certificates.

### 5.5. General Administration
*   User authentication (login/logout).
*   Role-based access to different modules/features (to be developed).
*   Admin interface for managing users, departments, and core data.
*   Audit trails for key actions.

## 6. Critical Technical and Non-Functional Requirements

*   **User-Friendliness:** Intuitive UI/UX, especially considering varying digital literacy. The Stitch UI mockups will guide this.
*   **Security:**
    *   Authentication: Secure login mechanisms.
    *   Authorization: Role-based access control.
    *   Data Integrity: Input validation.
    *   Data Backup: Regular backups (strategy to be defined, typically at database level).
    *   (Future) Data Encryption: For sensitive data at rest and in transit (HTTPS).
*   **Scalability:** System should be able to handle a growing number of users and data volume typical for a District Assembly. Django's architecture supports this.
*   **Reliability & Availability:** Aim for high uptime, especially during working hours.
*   **Maintainability:** Code should be well-organized, commented, and follow Django best practices for ease of future updates and maintenance.
*   **Auditability:** Comprehensive audit logs for accountability.
*   **Reporting:** Ability to generate key reports for decision-making.
*   **Local Context:**
    *   **Internet Reliability:** While web-based, consider potential for intermittent connectivity if deployed locally. For now, assumes stable connection to the server.
    *   **Digital Literacy:** UI design must be simple and intuitive. Training will be essential.
*   **Sustainability & Local Support:** Using a popular framework like Django aids in finding developers for support. Clear documentation is key.

## 7. Future Phases (Conceptual)

*   **Advanced Document Management System (DMS):** Version control, advanced search.
*   **GIS Integration:** Linking planning permits/properties to geographical maps.
*   **Mobile Money/Bank Payment Gateway Integration:** For revenue collection.
*   **Citizen Engagement Portal:** For citizens to track application status, access public info.
*   **Comprehensive Reporting & Analytics Dashboards:** Customizable KPIs for management.
*   **Internal Communications Module:** Enhanced messaging/notifications.

This conceptual design provides a starting point. Detailed design for each module will be elaborated upon as development progresses.
